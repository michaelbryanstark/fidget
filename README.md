To Do

# CRUD functionality for posts. 
Create functions in controllers/ 

Create routes to each in routes/ 

Then create createPost.ejs? to use in post testing

(I can't access DB, don't know how, without ejs interface. Ask Nicole!)
Nicole says plug URI into Mongo Atlas. Alternatively, finish the ejs files!
